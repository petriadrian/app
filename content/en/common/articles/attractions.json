The name 'Detunata' (blast) comes from the deafening sound that the collapsing rocks made, but now it's quiet and some of the rocks are covered with moss which makes an unique landscape. Explore the area! Here lived 'Fefeleaga'- The main character in the work of 'Ion Agârbiceanu'.

During communism the villagers were moved away and the waste from the 'Rosia Poieni' exploitation was thrown all over the village. Now only the tower of the village church can be seen here in the middle of 'hell'.",
