The maps of the trails are made in <b>google maps</b>, so you can zoom in, see them in satellite mode or access them on any smartphone or tablet. Under each trail you'll find indications estimated by us (<b>round trip distance</b>, duration). The indications within the map are provided by google. When you don’t ride your bike, you can keep it safe in our garage."
