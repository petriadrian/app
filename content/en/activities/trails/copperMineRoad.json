From here we enjoy to let go downhill with the highest speed along the Corna village until we reached Abrud. We had a break here, buy an ice cream and rest a little in the Historic Center. Then the hard part of the trail starts: going uphill back home on a unpaved road along the Selişte village. On our way we stopped to the Țapului Lake to swim and refresh a little. From here we were almost home.</i> We challenge you also to follow this trail and taste the pleasures of our childhood. In 'Gura Corna' you can dine (we recommend 'Laguna' restaurant or 'Detunata'). This is a tail for mountain bikes.",
