Perhaps due to eruption of this volcano we have now a rich mineral resources area. To reach it you will have to go from Casa Petri to Gura Rosiei -> Abrud -> Ciuruleasa -> Vulcan. The road is quite spacial because you will go by the 'Abrud' mountains and a pine forest whose smell I'm pretty sure you'll remember long time after. To get to the top of Vulcan, from the asphalted road, you’ll have to go uphill on a unpaved road.",
